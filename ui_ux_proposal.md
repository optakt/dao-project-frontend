# UI/UX Study on DAO Simple Project (interface)

## Abstract

For the DAO Simple Project itâ€™s needed a system to allow a comunity to make proposals on differents topics. Each of this proposals will be summited as a POLL for beign accepted or rejected by the comunity. After some predefined Time ends (TIMELOCK). After this time end could happend some differents scenarios: The Poll reach a minimun qorum required and was approved or it was denied or in case this minimun quorum was not obtained, the proposal will be denied. The system will allow this behavior based on a Smart Contract and using IPFS for the storage of the Polls.
